### How can this be mitigated?

What I'm suggesting, is something along the lines of this:

## How to build

1. Clone source code using `git clone https://github.com/AyuGram/AyuGram4A.git`
2. Open the project in Android Studio. It should be opened, **not imported**
3. Replace `google-services.json` (we don't want to see crash reports from your app...)
4. Generate application certificate and fill API_KEYS:
   ```
   APP_ID = 6
   APP_HASH = "eb06d4abfb49dc3eeb1aeb98ae0f581e"
   GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID = "your-google-auth-client-id-here.apps.googleusercontent.com"
   MAPS_V2_API = abcdef12345678
   
   SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD = password
   SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS = alias
   SIGNING_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD = password
   ```
5. You are ready to compile `KESGram`

- **KESGram** can be built with **Android Studio** or from the command line with **Gradle**:
```
./gradlew assembleAfatRelease
```
- _Base code for AyuHistoryHook and AyuMessageUtils derived from [Dr4iv3rNope's Fork](https://github.com/Dr4iv3rNope/NotSoAndroidAyuGram)_
